### Description
If you ever loved or still love comic books, superheroes, or supervillains, then this is the app for you. There are those out there that try and stay true to just one universe that holds their beloved characters. However,there are those like me, that love the Capcom game that used a cross platform list of characters. Who wouldn't want to see how the Justice League would do in a fair battle against the Avengers? But, why stop there? What if you could throw Luke Skywalker into the mix with a Godzilla counterpart? Doesn't that just sound coooool? Well, here at Superheroes-R-Us that is exactly what you can do! Sign up and Login to your account to start building a Team 1 versus Team 2 matchup. Compare the powerstats from over 700 heroes or villains to answer that nagging question all us comic lovers have: What If...?
